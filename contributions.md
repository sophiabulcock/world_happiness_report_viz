# Summary of Contributions

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member (including yourself) made to your project. 
Both partners should contribute to this file from their own perspectives.
Point form is fine, but you should use the following format:

## Group Work

Ryan and Sophia worked well together, splitting up the workload fairly evening and communicating updates regularly.  They put a combined effort in to figure out how to get the visual of world with an overlay of data.

## Contributions

### Ryan's Contributions

- Ryan wrote up the data description, helped located the data to be used, assisted in the wrangling of data, as well as setting up the API request for the country code to use the World visual.  He created the last two visuals as well as added to the summary, conclusion and second additional research question. He worked with Sophia to set up the World visualization.  

### Sophia's Role

- Sophia did the data exploration as well as initializing the data wrangling in composing all 6 data frames together.  She also worked on the wrangling needed for the first 3 data visualizations and found, and started the method to create the world visualization.  She contributed to both the overall summary and conclusion of the dataframe and wrote the first additional research question.

## Things that went well

- Things went fairly smoothly considering the workload from other classes and the later start on this project.  Both teammates were able to critique and assist in making the visualizations. Communication over work times and pushing and pulling to the project was smooth so that there was no merge issues.

## Things that went poorly

- Altair felt a bit finicky in trying to get repeated graphs to visually look well, with limitations in layering if they were already repeated.  The information we found for helping us create the world visual lacked some key information so it took awhile to figure out exactly how to get it to work.
